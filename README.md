Overview of the Library Management System Project

Project Purpose and Scope The Library Management System project aims to streamline the management of library resources such as books, magazines, and DVDs. The system includes functionalities for adding new items, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, searching for items by various criteria, and supporting multiple user roles (librarian and patron). Data persistence is achieved using file handling to ensure that library data is saved and retrieved between sessions.

Key Components The project is divided into several key components:

LibraryItem Class: Represents a generic library item with common attributes. Book, Magazine, DVD Classes: Specialized classes for different types of library items. User Class: Represents a user with different roles (librarian, patron). LibrarySystem Class: Manages the collection of library items and user interactions. FileHandler Class: Handles saving and loading library data to and from files for data persistence. Main Class: Contains the main program logic, including user interaction and handling different library operations.

Conclusion This project provides a comprehensive library management system with essential features for managing library resources and user interactions. The use of file handling ensures data persistence, making the system reliable for repeated use. This structure can be extended with more advanced features and improvements based on specific requirements.
